# java-fundamentals


### Lab 01:
I have Main.java File and inside it:

I have function called pluralize:  that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.
 
and function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.

and i have a method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. 

LocalDateTime object and get the hours, minutes and seconds off.


### Lab 02:
I  Wrote a method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. 
then I wrote a method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.
and i wrote a function an array of arrays calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.
