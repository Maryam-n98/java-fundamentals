## Lab 03:
I used HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen, between max and min.

I wrote  tally function that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.

i Wrote a linterMassege method that read js file line by line.
Don’t show an error if the line is empty.
Don’t show an error if the line ends with an opening curly brace {
Don’t show an error if the line ends with an closing curly brace }
Don’t show an error if the line contains if or else

and it used  gates.js  to show every line had missing semicolons 

In the test, I test it in no errors file, one error file, few errors file, many errors file, and finally in an empty file.
