# java-fundamentals


### Lab 01:
I have Main.java File and inside it:

I have function called pluralize:  that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.
 
and function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row. Simulate coin flipping by choosing a random number between 0 and 1. Numbers below .5 are considered tails. Numbers at and above .5 are considered heads. Print out heads or tails on one line for each flip. Print It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row. once n heads have been in a row.

and i have a method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second. 

LocalDateTime object and get the hours, minutes and seconds off.


### Lab 02:
I  Wrote a method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. 
then I wrote a method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.
and i wrote a function an array of arrays calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.


### Lab 06:
In  Restaurant Class I implements RestaurantsInterface
have a name, a number of stars betweeen 0 and 5 using If statment, and a price category.
And I wrote a tests for the constructor Restaurant and for add new Restaurant.
 
In Review Class I implements ReviewInterface
have a body, an author, and a number of stars.
And I wrote a tests for the constructor  of Review and for add new Review.

I wrote a method addReview to Restaurant class.
 This method takes in a Review instance and associate that review with this Restaurant. 
 Then i wrote a test for it.

 the addReview method updates the Restaurant star rating I mean the restaurant star rating will change.  
  Then i wrote a test for it.


### Lab 07:
I Created a Shop class it have a name, description, and number of dollar signs, and I implements ShopInterface.
And I wrote a tests for the constructor shop and for add new Shop.

As what we have in Lab 06 for Restaurant we have for shop you can add a Review for each shop you want and This method takes in a Review instance and associate that review with this Shop,  Then i wrote a test for it.


 the addReview method updates the Shop star rating I mean the shop star rating will change.  
  Then i wrote a test for it.

I Created a Theater class have a name and all of the movies currently showing there, and I implements TheaterInterface.

I wrote two method one addMovie it will allow you to add any movie you want, and then you have another method removeMovie its allow you to remove any movie you add
and i wrote a tets for each method.

And here As what we for Restaurant and shop we have for movie you can add a Review for each movie you want and This method takes in a Review instance and associate that review with this movie,  Then i wrote a test for it.

And finally, someone reviewing a Restaurant or a Shop doesn’t have to include which movie they saw, it an optional.
